ðŸ“… Day 01 â€“ 15 July 2025

âœ… What I Learned Today

- Revised the **basics of HTML and CSS**, focusing on:
  - HTML5 conventions
  - Common HTML tags like:  
    - `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, etc.
- Understood the **difference between**:
  - `<div>` (block-level element) vs `<span>` (inline element)
  - `margin` vs `padding` in CSS (spacing outside vs inside elements)
- Explored how **CSS** enhances the appearance of HTML content.
- Learned to **upload files to GitHub** and started exploring **advanced Git/GitHub concepts** via YouTube tutorials.
