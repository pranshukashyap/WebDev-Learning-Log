Today on 15 July 2025,
-> I revised the basics of HTML and CSS like HTML5 conventions, Basic html tags like <div>, <span>, <h1 ... h6>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <button>, <input> etc.
-> Also deep dived in difference between <div> and <span>, Also <margin> and <padding>.
-> CSS usage to make the html look prettier.
-> Also, I've learnt to upload the files on github and Learning the advance git/github from YouTube.

This is my Day01, looking forward to learn more and more...
