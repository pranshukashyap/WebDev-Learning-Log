# 📅 Day 07 – 21 July 2025

## ✅ What I Learned

Today was a day of **consolidation and reflection**. I revisited everything I’ve learned over the past week — from HTML & CSS to async JavaScript and file handling in Node.js. Alongside that, I took my first steps into the world of **Bash commands**, which felt like unlocking a new superpower for working with the terminal!

### 🔁 Weekly Revision Highlights

- ✅ HTML & CSS Basics: tags, structure, styling, block vs inline elements
- ✅ JavaScript Fundamentals: `var`, `let`, `const`, operators, objects, arrays
- ✅ Asynchronous JavaScript:
  - `readFile` vs `readFileSync`
  - CPU vs I/O intensive tasks
  - Event loop, call stack, callback queue
  - Callback functions and functional arguments
- ✅ Node.js File System module (`fs`)
- ✅ Realization: JavaScript is not just a scripting language — it’s a whole system thinker.

### 🖥️ Bash Basics – My First Step into the Terminal

Today I began exploring **Bash**, the command-line shell used in many developer workflows. Here's what I covered:

#### 📂 Navigation & File System
📄 File & Directory Management
📑 Viewing & Editing
```bash
pwd            # Print working directory
ls             # List files and folders
cd foldername  # Change directory
cd ..          # Go back one level

mkdir myfolder         # Create a new folder
touch file.txt         # Create a new file
rm file.txt            # Delete a file
rm -r myfolder         # Delete a folder recursively

cat file.txt           # View contents of a file
echo "Hello" > file.txt  # Write to a file
echo "World" >> file.txt # Append to a file
//Extras
clear      # Clear the terminal screen
history    # Show list of previous commands
