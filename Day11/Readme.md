## 🌐 Project Kickoff: DEAD Gamers Club 🎮

Today marks the beginning of a new front-end adventure — **DEAD Gamers Club**, a modern and dynamic website for gamers by a gamer.

I didn't write much code today, and that's totally okay — because **planning is building** too.

### 🔍 What I Did Today

- 💡 **Conceptualized** the project idea and purpose.
- 🧠 **Brainstormed** features the site might have (landing page, team page, events, merch?).
- 🎨 **Thought about UI/UX** structure — sleek dark-themed layout, bold typography, gaming vibes.
- 🖼️ **Explored logo styles** — something edgy yet clean, maybe pixel-inspired or a modern twist on retro.
- 🗂️ **Started folder structure** for the project (HTML/CSS/JS separated neatly).
- 🧱 Decided to build the foundation using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, keeping things custom and flexible.

### 🔮 What’s Next?

- Start laying out the homepage — header, hero section, and initial components.
- Work on the branding: finalizing the logo and picking a color palette 🎨.
- Define how users will interact with the site (navigation, call-to-action, etc.).
- Maybe I will learn basic Figma and wireframe a few sections in it or on paper.

### 🧠 Reflection

Sometimes the hardest part is starting. But today was about setting the **tone** and **ambition** for what this project could become. DEAD Gamers Club isn't just a website — it’s a tribute to gaming culture, design, and code craft. Super excited to bring it to life, one div at a time!
