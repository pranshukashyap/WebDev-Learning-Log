# 📇 Contact Saver Web App

A minimal yet modern web app that lets you add, display, and delete contact cards in your browser. It’s built using vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, applying everything I’ve learned so far — from DOM manipulation to async JavaScript and user interface styling.

## 🌟 Features

- 📥 Add a contact with name and email
- 🎴 Display contacts as sleek, card-style UI
- ❌ Delete any contact with a confirmation popup
- ⚡ Powered by `async/await` to mimic real server calls
- 🧠 Concepts covered:
  - DOM Manipulation
  - Form Handling
  - Callback Queues
  - Async JavaScript (`async/await`)
  - Functional Programming Patterns
  - Event Handling
  - UI Styling with modern CSS

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open `index.html` in any browser** (no setup needed)

2. **Start saving contacts**:
   - Fill the name and email fields
   - Click "Save Contact"
   - Contacts appear below as cards
   - You can delete any contact with the "Delete" button

> **Note**: All data is stored in memory for now. Refreshing the page will clear the contact list.

## 🎯 Motivation

This project is built as a hands-on exercise to combine all the core front-end concepts I learned during Days 1 to 9 of my web development journey:
- HTML & CSS fundamentals
- JavaScript basics + advanced concepts like async & callback queues
- Node.js FileSystem learning inspiration
- Modern UI structure and responsiveness
